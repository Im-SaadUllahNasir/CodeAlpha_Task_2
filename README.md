# Unemployment Analysis Project

## Overview
The **Unemployment Analysis Project** is a data science project aimed at understanding and predicting unemployment trends using historical data. The goal of this project is to analyze unemployment data from various regions and provide insights on the causes, patterns, and trends of unemployment. Additionally, the project involves creating a predictive model to forecast unemployment rates based on various factors such as economic indicators, government policies, and demographic data.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical unemployment data along with relevant economic indicators, demographic information, and other related factors.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between unemployment and other economic factors.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model to forecast future unemployment rates.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical operations)
  - Matplotlib (Data visualization)
  - Seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning and model evaluation)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x)
- Git (for version control)


4. Open the `notebooks/01_data_cleaning.ipynb` file to start exploring the data.

### Running the Model
To train and evaluate the predictive model, you can use the code provided in the `03_modeling.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, or you can run the scripts in the `src/` directory.

## Data Description
- **Unemployment Data**: Contains historical data on unemployment rates by country/region, including the number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate.
- **Economic Indicators**: Includes data such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and more, which are used to explore the correlation with unemployment.
- **Demographic Data**: Includes age, education level, and other demographic factors that may influence unemployment.

## Key Insights
- The project analyzes the factors that contribute to unemployment, including economic indicators (GDP, inflation) and demographic factors.
- The model can predict future unemployment trends based on current data and economic conditions.
- Data-driven recommendations are provided for policymakers and businesses to mitigate unemployment.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time data through APIs to continuously update unemployment trends.
- Explore more advanced machine learning models such as neural networks or ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- Implement interactive visualizations to make the analysis more user-friendly.
